# Project Ideas Repository

Welcome!  
This is a living collection of project ideas across different areas of technology â€” from serious engineering builds to creative experiments.  
The goal is to explore, organize, and eventually develop projects for learning, portfolio growth, career advancement, or just pure fun.

## How This Repo Works
- Each category file (`.md`) lists specific project ideas.
- Each idea includes:
  - **Summary**
  - **Skills Developed**
  - **Difficulty** (1 Easy --> 5 Hard)
  - **Notes** (expansions, challenges, inspirations)
- Some ideas are marked * to prioritize favorites.

---

## Future Plans
- Continuously update with new ideas
- Expand notes and mini-roadmaps for chosen projects
- Possibly turn ideas into real repositories over time
