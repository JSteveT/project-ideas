# Project Overview: Prometheus Learn (Local Observability Stack)

A local observability stack for monitoring a simple web application and system metrics using Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter, all orchestrated via Docker Compose.

## Skills Developed:

- Web app instrumentation with Prometheus metrics
- Prometheus configuration and target scraping
- System monitoring via Node Exporter
- Grafana dashboard design and queries
- Docker Compose service architecture
- (Optional) Alerting with Alertmanager

## Difficulty: 3 (Intermediate)

## Notes:

- Can expand to monitor multiple services or simulate microservices
- Add PushGateway or Alertmanager for more advanced use
- Try converting to Kubernetes (Minikube) after local version works
- Inspired by real-world cloud observability stacks in DevOps and SRE
